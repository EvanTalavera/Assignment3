# Tanks A Lot!

Tanks A Lot is a top down 2D Armoured Fighting Vehicle game in which the player takes control of a tank, attempting to return back
to their base in one piece while defeating hostile vehicles

## Design Process

Tanks A Lot was designed around providing the player with an immersive and diverse play experience.
The game achieves this by providing various mechanics that require the player to both manage their resources while also making the 
right combat decisions.

We wanted to make it easy for the player to learn how to play the game, hence, we have designed the UI of the game to be as
intuitive as possible.

Wireframe and prototypes can be found under the Prototype file.
